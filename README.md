# get-cab
Free adaptation of the Gett android app.

This app uses Firebase realtime database (NoSQL) to store the information on requested trips and registered cabbies. It should be divided by trips (where newly created Trip objects will be sent/stored) and cabbies (where newly added cabbie accounts - i.e. Cabbie objects - will be sent/stored/verified).
Make sure to have such a database and to include its google-service.json file on the project folders.
